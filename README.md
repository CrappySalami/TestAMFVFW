# TestAMFVFW

Testing, testing...

VFW glue using AMD's Media SDK (AMF) aka encode video using VCE.

# WIP!!!
Can get only around 45 fps with 1080p on R9 290 for some reason.

Atleast Dxtory 2.0.130 for some reason doesn't seem to specify encode fps (through ICM_COMPRESS_FRAMES_INFO message). I've defaulted to 30 fps but you can override it.
